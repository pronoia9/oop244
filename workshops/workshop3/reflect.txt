1) What happens to dynamic memory if it is not deallocated?
The memory will keep being occupied with data that can no longer be used.

2) What are the two methods of formatting IO stream data?
std::setprecision() 
std::setw()

3) Why was dynamic memory required in the main() function of w3_in_lab.cpp to build the solution?
Cause we dont yet know the required size of the array beforehand, and we can't give a fixed size to something we don't know yet. The user input (n) decides the size.
