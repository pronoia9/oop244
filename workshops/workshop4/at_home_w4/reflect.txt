1) What is meant by a safe empty state?
a. What is the safe empty state in your program?
Set empty state in my program sets the values for the object to predefined empty states (0 for ints, false for bool, \0 for string)

b. Why did you select this state?
I don't know what this question is asking precisely, it is quite vague. What I understood is: Why is the function resetting the variables to a predefined state, which is 0? 
It's so that if one value is invalid, all the values are set to empty state.

2) Describe a case where having multiple Enrollment constructors would simplify the code of clients that use it.
For example, the constructor with no parameters initializes an Enrollment object with all private variables set to empty values. 
It would be an efficient/fast way to just create objects without worrying about putting valid input, or rather any input at all.
In another case we send in the parameters to initialize an object in a non-empty state, with the 2nd constructor with 5 parameters.
