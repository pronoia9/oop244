1. Explain how allocateAndCopy() function works in PhoneNumber.cpp
> Check the validity of the parameters (a phone number). 
If they are valid, it shallow copies the area and number, and it allocates memory and deletes the 
current type to copy the new type.


2. Explain why usually a copy constructor and assignment operator is needed when
a class uses dynamic memory allocation to hold its resources.
> Copy constructor and assignment operator ensures deep copying & deep assigning of resource data.
The copying also does shallow copying of static memory data.
In each deep copy, we allocate memory for resource and copy the contents into destination memory.
